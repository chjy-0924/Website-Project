  <p>Our First Week College Experience:</p>

  <div class="extra-content">
      <p><h4>By: Cherry Joy Toribio <br></h4>
        As expected, the first week was definitely exciting but also a bit nerve-wracking. I don’t remember much of what happened during that week, but I do recall meeting our professors for each subject and introducing ourselves to the class. I had the chance to get to know my classmates, and from there, I got an idea of who I wanted to be friends with. I’m glad there are other girls in our class because, back in senior high, I was the only girl in my strand. I made sure to take notes during our lessons, especially for our major subjects. Finally, my college journey has officially begun!</p>

        I can’t describe how my first week College experience went. For someone who came from the same school, the environment was without a doubt, different. I felt new to the place again and didn’t know everyone else. I had to adjust again to my surroundings and other people. I wouldn’t say it went okay for me, but I guess it wasn’t all that bad. I just always had a hard time interacting with different and new people.</p>

        My first week of college was both exciting and overwhelming as I adjusted to a new environment and schedule. Meeting my professors and classmates gave me a sense of community, and the orientation activities were informative. The lectures were engaging, and I quickly realized the importance of time management to balance academics and extracurriculars. Not having an adviser is one thing I only got used to in college. Overall, it was a promising start to what I hope will be a fulfilling college journey.</p>

        My first week of college experience makes me nervous knowing that I'm here in college. I still keep overthinking if I get friends along the way. To my surprise, everyone seems so friendly and approachable it kinda gives me motivation to talk to them you know? And kinda gives me to be friendly with them you know? To my surprise, I saw my classmate friend when we were in high school and he’s the first one I talk to because he’s the only classmate that I know too well. Time flies and I talk to two of my classmates his name is Mark and Felest they were so approachable you know? Knowing them is not a mistake, anyways my first week of college experience is kinda hard knowing my course is BSIT a lots of challenges came to me like having a time management to any assignments that will given to us college is no joke and college experience is needed to be taken it seriously unlike in my highschool days I get a passing grade I am happy, but in college is whole lot different story when you get a passing grade you have to make sure that you will graduate and it kinda gives me a pressure knowing that I need to be serious in academics, but I get the chance to have my skills in programming to the programming lessons, because I have a experience to coding because my last year’s school teaches us the basics in coding so that’s why I chose BSIT course because of my experiences in coding. But along the way I build connections and have a group of friends to have a best experience in college.</p>
