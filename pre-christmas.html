    <p>As the Christmas season is approaching, students and teachers have pumped up their game by preparing decorations for the upcoming Festival of Lights on November 27, 2024. TED college students were assigned to build at least 5 sheeps per class section made out of recycled bottles. It will serve as a decoration at the event besides the Belen showcasing these animals watching over the birth of Jesus.</p>
    <p>Students from different courses gathered and contributed their help by bringing the materials needed such as 1.5 liter plastic bottles, a water gallon that serves as the body of the sheep, glue guns and paints. To make the sheep possible, students cut out the plastic bottles in half as well as the heel/base of the bottle. The half cut-out bottles served as the legs of the sheep while the cut-out base was wool. Then, students used white paint for the body and face. To make the face, students used recycled folders and made it look like a sheep.</p>
    <p>With this collaboration, students were able to accomplish the task and also had the opportunity to socialise with other students from different courses while doing hard working tasks.</p>

    <p>A joyful celebration of Christmas Lighting was held at FEU Roosevelt Marikina on 27th of November, 2024, where students anticipated the Festival of Lights together with the other performances that really gave everyone at the venue that warm feeling of the Christmas season. The shimmering and flickering vibrant lights felt like a warm hug and brought the students and teachers together. The magical event was filled with excitement and celebration that captures the spirit of the Holiday!</p>
    <p>Christmas Lighting is an event held every year in the month of December or a week earlier before December for the Tamaraws as a welcoming to the season of gift-giving and spreading joy. Students from different year levels started off the event with entertaining performances that really hyped up everyone, singing Christmas songs while others danced with full energy in their festive outfits.</p>
    <p>The countdown started, students and teachers gathered outside of the school gymnasium filled with cheers where excitement and anticipation was evident in their voices. As the countdown came to an end, Christmas decorations lit up the school grounds along with the Christmas Tree and Belen. The Festival of Lights isn't the only highlight of the event. After lighting up the sparkling Christmas lights, a wonderful and colorful fireworks display awed everyone at the event and it just made the event more magical than it already is.</p>
    <p>Witnessing the Festival of Lights made everyone's night, spending time together and mingling with friends is a memory that will be cherished in each of our hearts. This memorable event brought life and light to each of the students' faces reminding everyone the essence of Christmas and that it feels good to get along well with everyone.</p>
